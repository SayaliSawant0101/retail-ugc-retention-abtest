# Experiment Decision Memo — Post-Purchase UGC Confidence Email

## Objective
Improve repeat purchase among paid-acquisition users without increasing return rates or relying on discounts.

---

## Background
Paid-acquisition users converted on the first purchase but showed materially lower D30 repeat purchase compared to organic users. Historical retention efforts often relied on promotions, increasing discount dependency and reducing margins.

We hypothesized that the paid-user retention gap is partly driven by **post-purchase uncertainty / buyer’s remorse**, and that authentic social proof after delivery could increase brand attachment and confidence.

## Hypothesis
Providing a post-purchase UGC confidence email (real customer usage/styling examples) will increase D30 repeat purchase among paid-acquisition users.

---

## Experiment Design
- **Population:** Paid-acquisition first-time purchasers
- **Control:** Order confirmation + shipping emails
- **Treatment:** Control + UGC confidence email sent **5–7 days after delivery**
- **Primary Metric:** D30 repeat purchase rate
- **Secondary Metrics:** time to next purchase, repeat order value, discount usage on repeat
- **Guardrails:** return rate within 14 days

Organic users were included as a **benchmark cohort** (not randomized).

---

## Results (Paid Users)
### Primary Impact
- **D30 repeat purchase:** 8.9% → 14.8%
- **Lift:** +5.9 pp (+66%), statistically significant (p < 0.001)

### Guardrails & Quality
- **Return rate:** no significant increase (p = 0.71)
- **Repeat order value:** stable (no degradation)
- **Time to next purchase:** no significant change (natural repeat behavior)

### Margin Signal
- **Discount usage on repeat:** 49.8% → 39.1%
- **Change:** −10.7 pp (p < 0.001)

---

## Diagnostics (Why it worked)
- **Email openers:** 18.1% repeat rate
- **Non-openers:** 13.0% repeat rate
- Strongest lift by category: **Home, Apparel, Footwear**
- Lift positive across all regions, strongest in **NE & West**

---

## Decision
✅ **Ship and scale** to all paid-acquisition users with monitoring.

---

## Rollout Plan
- Canary rollout 10–20% for 1 week (monitor returns/unsubs)
- Ramp to 50% (2–3 weeks)
- Full rollout to 100% if guardrails remain stable

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **UGC fatigue:** rotate content pools, refresh quarterly
- **Over-messaging:** cap frequency, suppress recent converters
- **Category mismatch:** use educational content for functional categories

---

## Next Experiments
1. Subject line A/B test to increase open rate  
2. Personalize UGC by category / region  
3. Timing test (3 vs 5 vs 7 days post-delivery)
